# Prism

Prism is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications in WPF, Xamarin Forms, Uno Platform and WinUI. Separate releases are available for each platform and those will be developed on independent timelines. Prism provides an implementation of a collection of design patterns that are helpful in writing well-structured and maintainable XAML applications, including MVVM, dependency injection, commands, EventAggregator, and others. Prism's core functionality is a shared code base supported in .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Framework 4.6 / 4.7, and .NET6.0/.NET8.0. Those things that need to be platform specific are implemented in the respective libraries for the target platform. Prism also provides great integration of these patterns with the target platform.

## Licensing

The Prism Team would first and foremost like to thank all of those developers who have stepped up over the past 4 years with GitHub Sponsors. We are committed to ensuring the longevity and success of the Prism Library. As a result Prism 9.0 is now [Dual License](LICENSE). We continue to offer a FREE Community License for the vast majority of our community, while the Commercial License will now be required by larger organizations to help fund and support the development of Prism. We additionally have the Commercial Plus License which grants access to a number of additional support libraries that build on top of Prism as well as a private Discord channel where you can ask questions and interact with the Prism Team.

## NuGet Packages

Official Prism releases are available on NuGet. Prism packages are also available on the private Commercial Plus Feed which will be updated with each merged PR. If you want to take advantage of a new feature as soon as it's merged into the code base, or if there is a critical bug you need fixed we invite you to purchase the Commercial Plus License to take advantage of these packages.

### Core Packages

These are the base packages for each platform, together with the Prism's Core assembly as a cross-platform PCL.

| Platform | Package | NuGet | Commercial Plus Feed |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| Cross Platform | [Prism.Core][CoreNuGet] | [![CoreNuGetShield]][CoreNuGet] | [![CorePrismNuGetShield]][CorePrismNuGet] |

| Uno Platform and WinUI | [Prism.Uno][UnoNuGet] | [![UnoNuGetShield]][UnoNuGet] | [![UnoPrismNuGetShield]][UnoPrismNuGet] |

### Container-specific packages

Each supported IoC container has its own package assisting in the setup and usage of that container together with Prism. The assembly is named using this convention: Prism.*Container.Platform*.dll, e.g. **Prism.Unity.Wpf.dll**. Starting with version 7.0, Prism is moving to separate packages for each platform. Be sure to install the package for the Container and the Platform of your choice.
